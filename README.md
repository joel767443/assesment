# Assessment

I have created this app as part of an assessment today 2020-04-04. This is just a date picker but the mini project has webpack and other packages.

##Installation
1. Clone the project `git clone git@github.com:joel767443/assesment.git`
2. cd assessment
3. npm install
4. npm start to start the app, and process the JavaScript and CSS files.
5. and lastly, visiting this ulr http://localhost:8080/ will display the date picker
